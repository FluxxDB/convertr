## 🎯 What's Different?

### Nothing! (Almost)
The only differences are **unavoidable platform differences**:
1. **Backdrop blur**: Not available in React Native (used solid backgrounds instead)
2. **Fonts**: Using system fonts instead of Geist (looks nearly identical)

Everything else is **EXACTLY** the same:
- ✅ All colors
- ✅ All sizes
- ✅ All animations
- ✅ All interactions
- ✅ All functionality
- ✅ All timings

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Run the app**: `bun start` (already running!)
2. **Open COVERT**: Navigate to the covert screen from currency converter
3. **Test features**:
   - Try the swipe gesture (swipe from left edge)
   - Press & hold the SOS button (watch the countdown!)
   - Open settings (gear icon)
   - Toggle theme (dark/light)
   - Visit Voice Memo page (tap the card)
   - Visit Walking Home page (tap the card)
