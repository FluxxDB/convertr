# Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a covert communications app disguised as a currency converter for individuals in domestic high-risk situations.

## What Was Built

### 1. App Structure
- Created Expo Router-based app with file-based navigation
- Set up three main routes:
  - `app/index.tsx` - Currency converter (cover app)
  - `app/covert.tsx` - Covert app screen
  - `app/_layout.tsx` - Root layout with navigation

### 2. Currency Converter (Cover App)
- Converted the Next.js currency converter to React Native
- Maintains all original styling and functionality:
  - Green gradient header (#40916c)
  - Clean white card design
  - 10 currency support (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, AUD, CAD, CHF, CNY, INR, MXN)
  - Real-time conversion calculations
  - Currency swap functionality
  - Uses `react-native-picker-select` for currency selection dropdowns

### 3. Password Detection
- Implemented password detection in the amount input field
- Password: `123456`
- When entered, automatically navigates to covert app
- Seamless transition without obvious UI changes

### 4. State Management
- Created `AppStateContext` to manage app state
- Provides `activateCovertMode()` function
- Uses Expo Router for navigation between cover and covert apps

### 5. Covert App Structure
- Created separate `covert-app/` folder as requested
- Contains its own components folder
- Currently displays "covert" on a white background (placeholder for future development)
- Organized structure for easy expansion:
  ```
  covert-app/
  ├── components/
  │   └── CovertMain.tsx
  └── README.md
  ```

## Cross-Platform Support
The app is configured to run on:
- ✅ iOS (via Expo Go or development build)
- ✅ Android (via Expo Go or development build)
- ✅ Web (via Expo web)

## Key Files Created

### App Routes
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Root layout with Stack navigation
- `app/index.tsx` - Home page with currency converter
- `app/covert.tsx` - Covert app page

### Components
- `components/CurrencyConverter.tsx` - Main currency converter component with password detection
- `covert-app/components/CovertMain.tsx` - Covert app main component

### Context
- `contexts/AppStateContext.tsx` - Global state management for app mode switching

### Documentation
- Updated `README.md` with project overview and usage instructions
- Created `covert-app/README.md` for covert app documentation
- Created `IMPLEMENTATION.md` (this file) for technical details

## How It Works

1. **Normal Mode**: User sees a fully functional currency converter app
2. **Password Entry**: User enters "123456" in the amount field
3. **Mode Switch**: App detects password via `useEffect` in CurrencyConverter component
4. **Navigation**: Calls `activateCovertMode()` which uses Expo Router to navigate to `/covert`
5. **Covert Mode**: User sees the covert app interface (currently a placeholder)

## Styling Preservation
All styling from the original Next.js currency converter has been preserved:
- Gradient green header with decorative circles
- Clean white card design with shadows
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Result display with green accents
- Mobile-responsive layout

## Dependencies Used
- `expo-router` - File-based navigation
- `react-native-picker-select` - Currency selection (already in package.json)
- React Native core components (View, Text, TextInput, TouchableOpacity, ScrollView)
- TypeScript for type safety

## Future Development
The covert app structure is ready for expansion:
- Add messaging functionality
- Implement secure communication features
- Add Firebase backend integration
- Enhance security measures
- Add additional cover app features to make it more convincing

## Testing the App

To test the implementation:

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the development server
bun start

# Select your platform:
# - Press 'w' for web
# - Press 'a' for Android
# - Press 'i' for iOS
# Or scan the QR code with Expo Go app
```

Once running:
1. You'll see the currency converter
2. Enter "123456" in the Amount field
3. The app will switch to the covert screen

## Notes
- The TypeScript linter may show module resolution errors until the TS server restarts
- All imports use the `@/` alias configured in tsconfig.json
- The Next.js prototype in `currency-app-nextjs/` remains as reference
- No existing functionality or styling was modified - only converted to React Native
