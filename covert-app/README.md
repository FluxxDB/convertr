# Covert App

This folder contains the covert communications app that is revealed when the password "123456" is entered into the currency converter's amount field.

## Structure

- `components/` - React Native components for the covert app
  - `CovertMain.tsx` - Main component displaying the covert interface

## Usage

The covert app is automatically activated when the user enters the password "123456" in the amount field of the currency converter. The app will navigate to the covert screen.

## Future Development

This is currently a placeholder showing "covert" on a white background. The actual covert communications functionality should be implemented here in future iterations.
